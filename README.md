# pdphmc
Piecewise deterministic processes using Hamiltonian dynamics


This is the development version of the R-package pdphmc, which is used in the paper "Connecting the Dots: Towards Continuous Time Hamiltonian Monte Carlo" by Tore Selland Kleppe [https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01285](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01285)


See also [https://github.com/torekleppe/PDPHMCpaperCode]( https://github.com/torekleppe/PDPHMCpaperCode) for the model- and data files, and the specific version of the package used in the above paper.

The R-package has currently been tested on mac (using the clang compiler) and windows 10 (using the mingw64 compiler that ships with Rtools4.0). In general, it requires that you have a working installation of R and a working installation of the R-package rstan.
